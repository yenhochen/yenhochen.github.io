  abstract = "The ability to perceive spatial environments and locate oneself
              during navigation is crucial for the survival of animals.
              Mounting evidence suggests a role of the medial prefrontal cortex
              (mPFC) in spatially related behaviors. However, the properties of
              mPFC spatial encoding and how it is influenced by animal behavior
              are poorly defined. Here, we train the mice to perform 3 tasks
              differing in working memory and reward-seeking: a delayed
              non-match to place (DNMTP) task, a passive alternation (PA) task,
              and a free-running task. Single-unit recording in the mPFC shows
              that although individual mPFC neurons exhibit spatially selective
              firing, they do not reliably represent the animal location. The
              population activity of mPFC neurons predicts the animal location.
              Notably, the population coding of animal locations by the mPFC is
              modulated by animal behavior in that the coding accuracy is
              higher in tasks involved in working memory and reward-seeking.
              This study reveals an approach whereby the mPFC encodes spatial
              positions and the behavioral variables affecting it.",
